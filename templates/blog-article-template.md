```python
# Always provide context and comments
def pose_estimation_pipeline(image_data):
    """
    Process image data through pose estimation model
    Returns: normalized pose coordinates
    """
    # Preprocessing step
    processed_image = preprocess_image(image_data)
    
    # Model inference
    poses = model.predict(processed_image)
    
    # Post-processing for accuracy improvement
    refined_poses = refine_predictions(poses)
    
    return refined_poses
```

### **Visual Elements to Include**
